            ArticleStory is a platform for publishing articles and stories, combining both written content and personal narratives. It was created by the developer as their first project using React, which initially led to a basic design. However, with Reactâ€™s flexible templating system, the website can now be easily redesigned and improved.
            The primary goal of the redesign is to bring new life to the platform, staying true to the developer's original vision: to provide a space where people can share their thoughts and opinions with minimal restrictions. While ArticleStory is not intended to be a source of scientific knowledge, it aims to be a platform for individuals to express themselves, as long as their content complies with our terms and conditions.
            Our new design focuses on simplicity, and we also implemented search bar when you are looking for an article or story. We also created a new logo for our platform, it may be simple but it is our logo.
